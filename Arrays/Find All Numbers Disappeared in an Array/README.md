# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array (Easy)

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)

## Description

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return an array of all the integers in the range `[1, n]` that do **not** appear in `nums`.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time and uses **only constant extra space**, excluding the space needed for the output array.

---

## Example 1

**Input:**  
`nums = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]`

**Output:**  
`[5, 6]`

---

## Example 2

**Input:**  
`nums = [1, 1]`

**Output:**  
`[2]`

---

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
